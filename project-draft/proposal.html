        <h1>INFO 340 Project Proposal: English-Mandarin Learning Website</h1>

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>According to the data found in <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/12868/the-worlds-most-spoken-languages/">statista</a>, there are 1.31 billion people who speak Chinese, about 16% of the world's population. Even though Mandarin is the largest language in the world, there are a mere 2.9 million Chinese speakers in the US, just 0.8% of the population. As Mandarin is well-known as a difficult language to learn, most people do not know how to start their journey to learn it. Thus, we plan to create a website to address the problem of Chinese learning for English speakers and provide them with a platform to enjoy the beauty of Mandarin.</p>
        <p>There are Chinese-learning websites and applications out there that help people get to know Chinese, such as <a href="https://www.busuu.com/">Busuu</a>, however, these websites focus on teaching people entire sentences at a time, which can be too complicated for beginners. We plan to focus on teaching single words to our users, which will be more beginner-friendly. Our website will be an introductory step for beginners who want to learn Mandarin, which we will accomplish by focusing on teaching singular words to our users.</p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Users:</h3>
                <p>Our users can be any people of any age who is an English speaker willing to learn Chinese, however we will be primarily targeting those who are just starting out to learn Mandarin. This website will help the spread and popularization of Chinese in English-dominanted countries.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Features:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>An English-Mandarin dictionary, where users can type in words in English that they want to learn and get the corresponding Chinese words, pronunciations, and definitions.</li>
                    <li>A multiple choice quiz that will present the user with either a Chinese word, an English word, or an image, to which the user must answer by choosing the matching Chinese or English word. The words that the user fails to get right will be stored, allowing the user to view a list of them and their definitions aside from the ordinary dictionary. The quiz will have options for either using the entire dictionary or only the words the user has gotten incorrect.</li>
                    <li>A graph that will show the user their quiz results, and the trend of their scores. The user can change the graph to display their most recent scores or their entire results history, as well as show the scores of only a specific type of question (Chinese word, English word, or image).</li>
                    <li>Chinese homonymous words comparison. Chinese words are made up with different radicals and character parts, and combination of the these parts makes up various words. Thus, there are a lot of words share the same parts but with totally different meanings and pronunciations. In this section, we will help users to find out words with the same character part and compare them, allowing users to remember what each word means from their different subcomponents.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In addition, we also plan on having an account feature, where users will log in using their email and password, which will allow them to store and access their quiz results from anywhere.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Information:</h3>
                <p>Users will view information from our English-Mandarin dictionary, which will be pulled from this <a href="https://github.com/lxs602/Chinese-Mandarin-Dictionaries">website</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Problem-solving:</h3>
                <p>As pointed out above, Chinese has a high learning threshold, so the goal of our website is the lower this threshold by making our users find Chinese to be a more accessible language. Instead of teaching long sentences like other Chinese learning websites, our website's functions focus on teaching individual words to the user, which is simpler and easier to grasp for those new to learning Mandarin. In addition, unlike other existing learning platforms that rely on fixed courses, our website is much more flexible, as it allows users to learn whichever words they wish via our dictionary feature and view which words they struggle with, offering our users even more possibilities for their learning.</p>
